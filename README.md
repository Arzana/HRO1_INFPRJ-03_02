The project of the course INFPRJ-03 (group 2)

In order to protect your machine and your sanity, it is important not to run the application in Visual Studio. There is a large chance that Visual Studio will simply abort the process after aproximatly 60 seconds due to the program taking longer than that to respond. TL;DR: Visual Studio is an impatient little brat and our program does not conform to its impatience.
Instead, it is advised to run the application outside Visual Studio, so that the application actually runs. If you are just as impatient as Visual Studio, run it in Release mode.

You have been warned.
Good day to you.
